# 🧪 Molecular Consumption Logic

LabOptimizer AI models the **physical behavior of laboratory reagents**.

## Consumption Map

Each laboratory test is mapped to:
- Primary reagent volume (R1)
- Secondary reagent volume (R2)

## Additional Automated Deductions

- Wash cycles per sample
- Calibration runs
- Quality control executions
- Wastage compensation factor
- Dead volume threshold logic

The system treats reagent depletion as a **physics-aware process**,
not a simple counter.

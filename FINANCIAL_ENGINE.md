# 💰 Financial Pulse Engine

The financial engine calculates **real operational profit**, not estimates.

## Dual Currency Handling

- Base reagent costs in USD
- Sales prices in local currency
- Manual exchange rate control

## Net Profit Logic

Net Profit =  
Sales Price – (Reagent Cost × Exchange Rate × Operational Factor)

The system links **every test** to its true financial impact.

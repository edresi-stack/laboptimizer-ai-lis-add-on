# 🧪 LabOptimizer AI  
### Intelligent LIS Middleware & Laboratory Operations Engine

LabOptimizer AI is a next-generation **LIS Middleware system**
designed to bridge **medical analyzers, inventory, and financial logic**
into a single intelligent operational engine.

🔒 The production codebase is private due to laboratory data sensitivity.
This repository presents the **system architecture, integration logic,
and operational intelligence design**.

## 🧠 What This System Is (And Is Not)

This is **not** a traditional LIS data-entry system.

LabOptimizer AI functions as an **intelligent middleware layer** that:
- Listens directly to laboratory analyzers
- Interprets HL7 messages in real time
- Translates test execution into reagent consumption
- Reflects true operational and financial impact

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

- Backend: FastAPI (real-time processing engine)
- Frontend: Next.js (Arabic / English, low-connectivity friendly)
- Database: PostgreSQL (tests, inventory, financial movements)
- Deployment: Dockerized isolated environment

## 🔌 Intelligent Integration Engine

- HL7 over MLLP listener (TCP)
- Real-time HL7 message parsing
- Analyzer-agnostic design
- Shadow Mode for non-intrusive monitoring

## 🧪 Core Capabilities

- Automated reagent consumption tracking
- Real-time inventory decrement
- Stability and expiry intelligence
- Financial pulse monitoring
- Predictive stock depletion alerts

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

> Laboratory systems should understand **how tests are performed**,  
> not just record that they were performed.
